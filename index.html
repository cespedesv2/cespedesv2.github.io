<tr>
<td>FAVORITE ANIMAL: I love penguins. I've been obsessed with them since I was a little girl </td>
<td>FAVORITE FOOD: Penne vodka on pizza. This is my literal deathrow meal. I could eat this everyday and never get tired of it. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FAVORITE MOVIE: The Greatest Showman. I love musicals and the story behind this one is my favorite.</td>
<td>ALTERNATE CAREER: If I wasn't a child advocacy major, I definitely would be a fashion major. I love clothes and the ways you can experiment with different clothing items and accessories. It is my favorite form of self-expression. </td>

<p style="font: bold 16px cursive;color:pink;text-align:left;">Hi! I'm Val. I am 18 years old. This is my first year of college. I have worked only one job at HomeGoods and I currently still work there. I am Costa Rican and Ecuadorian. I live with my parents and dog, Loki. I have two bestfriends Mya and Jeremy and I hang out with them pretty much everyday. When I graduate, I would like to continue my education and get my masters in social work. I plan on helping children stay in safe households in order to live a good life. I am also an advocate for mental health in adolescents. </p>
